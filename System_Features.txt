+ Student Grade and Performance Prediction
 - use deomographic and other features as well as current grades to predict future grades
 - predict final (Wassce) grades from current grade
 - analyse most important features affecting grades (using model agnostic methods)
 - tell to what degree those features affect outcome (partial dependecy plot)
 - tell why a particular students grades are changing so (every semester students would need to update their info), LIME
 - teachers will do student assessment at the end of term
 - explainability through model agnostics methods
 - study features importances for high performing students
 - study feature importances for poor performing students
 

+ Future course prediction 

+ Finance forecasting
 - predict when full payment will be made be made by particular student (like percentage of full semester time)
 - predict probability of student dropping out before paying fees
 

+ Teacher performance prediction
 - use features and student overall performance to predict future performance


TODO:
+ class and students rating by teacher after class (num_hands_raised, quiz_score, num_disturbed_in_class, num_questions_answered)
