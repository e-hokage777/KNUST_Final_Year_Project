The realm of educational administration, particularly in developing countries like Ghana, faces significant challenges stemming from outdated administrative processes and reliance on intuitive decision-making. This literature review aims to explore the existing research and scholarly discourse surrounding the transition towards advanced school management through informed decision-making practices. Specifically, the review will address the prevalence of paper-based administrative systems, the implications of intuitive decision-making, and the potential benefits of adopting data-driven approaches in educational settings.

Importance of Effective School administration:
School administration plays a very crucial role in the school's overall performance. As leaders of their institutions, administrators are responsible for identifying the goals and visions of the school and coming out with clear plans on how to achieve those goals as well as constantly evaluating progress.
Listed below are some roles of school administrators:

1. Leadership:
Administrators must provide a clear vision to guide school improvement efforts.
They are responsible for fostering a positive and supportive school culture that fosters love of learning and high expectations for students.
Research  suggests  that  transformational  leadership,  which  involves  inspiring  and  motivating followers to achieve shared goals, is most effective in promoting school improvement [1].

2. Communication:
Communication is a crucial aspect of improving schools. Administrators need to effectively communicate the school's vision, goals, and progress to all stakeholders, including faculty, students, parents, and the community. Effective communication entails active listening, providing timely feedback, and maintaining transparency.
Research suggests that open and transparent communication enhances
stakeholders' engagement and promotes a sense of ownership in the school improvement
Process.


3. Decision Making:
It can be said that the fate of the school rests on the ability of its administrator to make sound and optimal decisions at every point in time. Each decision made by a school administrator goes a long way to affect the performance of the school, hence administrators are to make sure not to make decisions solely on their intuition but to seek expert advice and make good use of available data.




Paper-Based Administrative Systems:
Administrative processes within educational institutions in Ghana and other developing countries are predominantly reliant on paper-based documentation systems. This archaic approach often necessitates manual sorting and retrieval of files, leading to inefficiencies and delays in accessing vital information. Researchers such as Smith (2018) have highlighted the inherent limitations of paper-based systems, emphasizing the need for modernization and digitization to streamline administrative workflows and enhance organizational effectiveness.




Dangers of Making Decisions Purely on Intuition:
Intuition, sometimes known as “gut feeling” is primarily influenced by knowledge and past experiences. Decision making that is based purely on intuition is aptly termed intuition-based decision making.
According to NDM, intuition is “an expression of experience as people build up patterns that enable them to rapidly size up situations and make rapid decisions without having to compare options” [3].
 As its name suggests, this form of decision making does not make use of any past data, hence is not evidence-based. This way of making decisions comes with a number of problems.

The decision maker is unable to correctly assign probabilities to events or even to list all possible outcomes and their combinations. This narrows the scope of the decision maker and most times leads to making suboptimal decisions.


The proliferation of decisions within organizations, both in terms of time and space, results in the formation of chains. These chains involve sub-decisions made at different times and levels, which then intertwine with one another. They are influenced by various justifications and criteria, leading to a multiplication of their effects and outcomes. Decision makers are unable to make clear sense of these convoluted chains if they are to rely solely on their intuition.


Given that decisions are based on the knowledge and experiences of a single person or a small group of people  in the intuition-based approach, there exists a high chance of the presence of cognitive bias in whatever decisions are made. Also, the limited and cognitive limitation of human decision makers is another setback in decision making. 


Decisions made or actions taken are “satisfycing” in nature. In that a seemingly good decision is good enough for the decision maker. There is a strong feeling of certainty in good ideas that are pulled from one’s intuition, hence the decision making process usually ends there. The decision maker stops looking for even better solutions and goes with the good enough one. [4]


Despite the drawbacks of intuition-based decision making, people inherently yearn for  that approach. There is some fascination towards leaders who are able to who use only their cognitive abilities to steer followers towards the right path, “superheroes” of sorts[2]


Why Data-Informed Decision Making:
Data-informed decision making is a process of using existing data to guide one’s decision making. Before any decisions are made, data is collected and analyzed. Insights drawn from the analyses of the collected to guide the decision process.


Factors affecting student performance:
The main goal of every educational institution is to give birth to elite individuals that would serve as great assets to their communities and ultimately the world. Student performance in competitive examinations is a primary metric that is used to guide educational institutions towards their ultimate goal. Hence it is necessary that all the factors that affect student performance are brought to light, to aid in decision making processes of administration.

Research has shown that student performance is influenced by a multitude of factors. These factors can be grouped as socio-economic, psychological, environment, demographic and behavioral.

Socio-Economic Background:
Individuals can be grouped into three classes on the basis of socioeconomic background; those with high socioeconomic status, middle level socioeconomic status and low socioeconomic status. Research has shown that there is a significant difference between individuals with high socioeconomic status and those with low economic status, but little difference between those belonging to the middle class and those in the high class.

Demographics:
Some demographic features that have been found to have a significant influence on student achievement are age, gender and settlement type.

A study found that students from rural areas score lower on academic tests than students from urban areas. The researchers attributed this to the fact that students in rural areas don’t have access to the same level of coaching and learning resources as urban students.[5].

Research has found that age also plays a fairly significant role in student performance. Older students tend to perform slightly better, likely due to their increased cognitive development and maturity[5].

Some studies have shown that gender does play a role in academic achievements of students but not at every level of education, and that generally  males perform better in science and math topics compared to their female counterparts[6].

Behavioural:
Researches made into student performance prediction have brought to light the crucial role that behavioral aspects of students affect their academic performance - “We confirmed that the behavioral feature is so crucial that the accuracy reaches 0.7905 without other features except behavioral feature”[7]. Some behaviors that were found to have positive correlation with student performance were:
Activeness in class discussions.
Frequency of raising hands to answer questions during class
Frequency of learning resource visits


Psychological:
Academic achievement of a student is significantly influenced by psychological factors. They include a student's emotional state, cognitive functions, and mental health, all of which have a big influence on how they approach learning and succeed. 

High levels of stress eventually contribute to low self-esteem, low self-esteem can lead to negative outcomes such as increased alcohol consumption and smoking which hinders academic progress[8].
