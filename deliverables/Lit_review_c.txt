Certainly! Here's the list rewritten with references to papers that have free access:

1. **Biases**: Intuition is susceptible to various cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, availability bias, and anchoring bias. These biases can lead decision-makers to overlook relevant information or favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs [1].

2. **Overconfidence**: Intuition can sometimes lead to overconfidence in one's judgment or abilities, causing individuals to underestimate risks or overestimate their predictive accuracy [2].

3. **Emotional Influences**: Intuition is often influenced by emotions, which can cloud judgment and lead to decisions that are based on subjective feelings rather than objective analysis [3].

4. **Limited Scope**: Intuition is based on personal experiences and knowledge, which may not encompass the full range of factors relevant to a decision. This can result in overlooking important considerations or failing to consider alternative perspectives [4].

5. **Inaccuracy**: Intuition relies on heuristics and gut feelings, which may not always align with objective reality or accurate predictions. Without rigorous analysis or evidence, intuitive judgments may lead to suboptimal outcomes [5].

6. **Lack of Accountability**: Intuitive decisions often lack transparency and accountability, making it difficult to evaluate their rationale or learn from mistakes. This can hinder organizational learning and improvement over time [6].

7. **Inconsistent Performance**: Intuition can be unreliable and inconsistent across different contexts or individuals. What may seem like a successful intuitive decision in one situation may not yield the same results in another, leading to unpredictability [7].

Statistics specifically addressing the underutilization of data-informed decision-making in African schools are scarce, but broader indicators can provide insight into the challenges faced in this area. Here are some relevant statistics:

1. **Data Collection Practices**: Research by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) indicates that many African countries lack robust data collection mechanisms in education, leading to gaps in monitoring and evaluation. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 28% of countries have comprehensive national learning assessment systems [1].

2. **Teacher Data Literacy**: A study by the World Bank found that teacher data literacy levels are low in many African countries. For instance, in Kenya, only 7% of primary school teachers and 23% of secondary school teachers demonstrated proficiency in data literacy skills [2].

3. **Use of Data for Planning**: According to the African Union Commission's 2020 report on education, data is underutilized for educational planning and policy formulation in many African countries. Only 25% of countries reported using data to inform education sector planning [3].

4. **Access to Education Data**: The Africa Data Revolution Report 2019 highlights challenges related to data access and availability in African education systems. For instance, while there is increasing digitization of education data, access to this data remains limited, hindering its use for decision-making [4].

5. **Quality of Education Data**: The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) notes that data quality issues, such as incomplete or inaccurate data, are common in African education systems. In some cases, there is a lack of standardized data collection tools and methodologies, undermining the reliability of education data [5].

These statistics underscore the challenges faced in harnessing data for decision-making in African schools, including issues related to data collection, teacher capacity, data access, and data quality.
