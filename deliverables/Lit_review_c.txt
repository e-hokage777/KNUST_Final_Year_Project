Certainly! Here's the list rewritten with references to papers that have free access:

1. **Biases**: Intuition is susceptible to various cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, availability bias, and anchoring bias. These biases can lead decision-makers to overlook relevant information or favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs [1].

2. **Overconfidence**: Intuition can sometimes lead to overconfidence in one's judgment or abilities, causing individuals to underestimate risks or overestimate their predictive accuracy [2].

3. **Emotional Influences**: Intuition is often influenced by emotions, which can cloud judgment and lead to decisions that are based on subjective feelings rather than objective analysis [3].

4. **Limited Scope**: Intuition is based on personal experiences and knowledge, which may not encompass the full range of factors relevant to a decision. This can result in overlooking important considerations or failing to consider alternative perspectives [4].

5. **Inaccuracy**: Intuition relies on heuristics and gut feelings, which may not always align with objective reality or accurate predictions. Without rigorous analysis or evidence, intuitive judgments may lead to suboptimal outcomes [5].

6. **Lack of Accountability**: Intuitive decisions often lack transparency and accountability, making it difficult to evaluate their rationale or learn from mistakes. This can hinder organizational learning and improvement over time [6].

7. **Inconsistent Performance**: Intuition can be unreliable and inconsistent across different contexts or individuals. What may seem like a successful intuitive decision in one situation may not yield the same results in another, leading to unpredictability [7].
