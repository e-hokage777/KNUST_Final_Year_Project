The education field has undergone changes in the few years due to technological advancements and an increasing focus on data driven methods. Traditional methods of school administration, characterized by manual processes and subjective decision-making, are being replaced by innovative systems that leverage data to inform decision-making and drive improvements in educational outcomes. The transition towards data-informed decision-making in school administration is driven by the recognition of its potential to address longstanding challenges and optimize administrative processes. Historically, schools have faced issues such as inefficient resource allocation, limited insights into student performance, and a lack of adaptability to changing educational landscapes. However, the emergence of smart technologies and analytical tools presents an opportunity to overcome these challenges and revolutionize school management. Our final year project seeks to contribute to this transformative shift by developing and implementing a Smart School Administrative System that harnesses the power of data to facilitate informed decision-making and enhance school management practices. By collecting diverse data points from various sources within the school environment, including student records, attendance data, financial transactions, and academic performance metrics, the system aims to provide administrators and educators with valuable insights into school operations. Through the analytical technique of ML (Machine Learning), the collected data will be analyzed to identify trends, and areas for improvements within administration.
"The Smart school administrative system" would foster informed decision-making, enabling administration to allocate resources effectively, plan curriculums, manage staff, and implement based on evidence to enhance student education.


Education has come a long way with the advancement of technology. These technological advancements has steered the educational sector towards adopting more data-informed methods in management. In the past, school management relied more on manual processes and subjective decision making, however with the advent of modern technology that is able to leverage collected data by deriving valuable insights, the educational sector is slowly shifting towards data-informed approaches.
In spite of all the benefits, that this modern technology provides, most African countries have not been able to capitalize on them.
Our project, the Smart School Administrative System seeks to contribute to the transformative shift by creating a freely available system that would assist schools in their managment processes. The Smart School Administrative systems provides tool for efficient data collection and management. Such data includes student records, attendance data, financial transaction as well as performance data. Through Machine Learning our system will derive valuable insights from the data in order to guide administration in making data-informed decisions. Reasearch has shown that decisions that are supported by evidence lead to more optimal outcomes. Hence this system is sure to lead to advancements in the education sector, especially for African countries as well as other developing countries.
